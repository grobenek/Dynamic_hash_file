# Dynamic Hash File with Quadtree for Geodetic System

## Description

This project implements a dynamic hash file in Java, integrated with a quadtree data structure. It's designed specifically for geodetic applications, providing efficient storage, retrieval, and spatial querying of geodetic data.

## Features

- **Dynamic Hashing:** Efficiently handles large datasets with the ability to resize dynamically based on the data load.
- **Quadtree Integration:** Enhances spatial data querying, making the system suitable for geodetic computations and mapping.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows tuning of hashing and tree parameters to suit different datasets and use cases.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher
- Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
